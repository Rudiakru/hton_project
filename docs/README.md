# Docs overview

This `docs/` folder is organized for a judge-friendly repository while keeping engineering references available.

- `engineering/`
  - Implementation specs and technical references used to build and harden the offline deterministic demo.
  - Examples: `IMPLEMENTATION_CUTLINE_V2.md`, `DEMO_HARDENING_REPORT.md`, `grid_schema.md`, `VALIDATION.md`, `validation_details.md`, `README_FULL.md` (full legacy README preserved).
- `strategy/`
  - Product/strategy narrative, pitch prep, and value framing for coaches/judges.
  - Examples: `COACHING_VALUE.md`, `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`, `PROJECT_GOALS.md`, `PITCH_*`, `THEME.md`, `Ideen.md`, `übersicht_project.md`.
- `archive_manifest/`
  - Manifest of documents moved off-repo into the Desktop archive for cleanliness (`HACKATHON_REPO_CLEANUP_ARCHIVE/`).

Notes
- Only the minimal top-level Markdown files remain for judges: `README.md`, `CHECKLIST_JUDGE_READY.md`, `VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` (and optional `LICENSE`).
- The demo remains offline and deterministic; moving docs does not affect tests or the demo pack.
