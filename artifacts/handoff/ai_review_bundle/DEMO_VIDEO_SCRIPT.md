# Backup demo video script (90–120s)

This is a **talk-track** you can read while clicking the stage-safe path:

`Start Demo` → `Next` → `Verification`

## 0–10s: Hook (problem)

“Coaches waste a lot of prep time scrubbing VODs to find the few moments that matter, then rebuilding evidence so players trust the takeaway.”

“We built an offline scouting console that turns match telemetry into **critical moments + tendencies + click-to-verify evidence**.”

## 10–40s: Start Demo (what happened + evidence)

Click `Start Demo`.

“This immediately opens a top moment and its evidence panel.”

“The key here is trust: every insight has an internal evidence drawer with a **match-scoped ±60s context window**. No external replay links, and it works offline.”

“So we can quickly answer: what happened, what happened around it, and what else looked similar in this match.”

## 40–80s: Next (scouting report + how to punish)

Click `Next`.

“Now we’re in the scouting report. These are observed tendencies from the demo dataset.”

“Because the sample size in the demo pack is small (`n=6`), we label confidence honestly as LOW — the intent is to generate hypotheses with evidence you can verify.”

“Click any pattern to open an example evidence instance and sanity-check the claim immediately.”

## 80–110s: Verification (judge-proof)

Scroll to `Verification`.

“This is our judge-proof layer: the demo pack is frozen and deterministic, and we run an offline integrity verifier. If `Verification issues` is `0`, every evidence reference is valid and match-scoped.”

“So the demo is reliable even with zero internet.”

## 110–120s: Close (ROI)

“The payoff is workflow acceleration: instead of a 30+ minute manual scan, you can reach moments, tendencies, and proof in about a minute of clicking — and it’s repeatable and offline.”
