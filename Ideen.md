To secure a "big win" in the "Sky's the Limit" hackathon, you must align your project with one of the four official mission categories while meeting the high technical and strategic standards set by the JetBrains and Cloud9 judging panel.

### **The Four Primary Topics for Winning Submissions**

All main category winners receive substantial cash prizes ($4,000–$6,000) and an all-expenses-paid trip to the Game Developers Conference (GDC). Your project must fall into one of these four areas:

| Category | Objective | "Big Win" Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Comprehensive Assistant Coach** | Merge micro-player stats with macro-team strategy using GRID data.

 | Create a "Moneyball" style tool that detects recurring individual mistakes and quantifies their impact on overall team strategy.

 |
| **Automated Scouting Report Generator** | Speed up opponent preparation for VALORANT or League of Legends.

 | Automatically generate concise reports highlighting preferred playstyles, site setups (VALORANT), or team compositions.

 |
| **AI Drafting Assistant (LoL)** | Provide data-driven guidance during the pick/ban phase.

 | Analyze champion pools, win rates, and synergies to generate optimized, real-time recommendations for coaches.

 |
| **Event Minigame** | Design a fast and memorable interactive experience for live event booths.

 | Build an engaging experience capable of being showcased at future Cloud9 event activations at the LCS or VCT.

### **What the Judges Want to See**

The judging panel evaluates projects based on four pillars: **Technological Implementation, Design, Potential Impact, and Quality of the Idea**. Based on the judges' professional backgrounds and research, they are looking for specific technical and strategic traits:

#### **1. Agentic AI and Efficiency (JetBrains Focus)**

JetBrains researchers, such as Tobias Lindenbauer and Aleksandra Eliseeva, are leading experts in "Agentic AI"—tools that can plan and execute complex tasks autonomously.

* **Context Management:** Judges will reward technical efficiency. Research by JetBrains suggests that "observation masking"—omitting old environment data while keeping reasoning intact—is often superior to complex summarization for keeping agents fast and cost-effective.
* **Infrastructure Quality:** Submissions should be robust and reproducible. Judges will look for high-quality software engineering, potentially utilizing the **Koog.ai** framework, a Kotlin-based tool developed by JetBrains specifically for building reliable AI agents.


* **Tool Integration:** The use of JetBrains IDEs and the AI coding agent **Junie** is explicitly encouraged and factored into the "Technological Implementation" score.

#### **2. Actionable Intelligence and Speed (Cloud9 Focus)**

Strategic leaders like Halee Mason and Sam Saxena value tools that solve real-world bottlenecks.

* **Speed of Insight:** Cloud9's Halee Mason has emphasized that the competitive edge comes from how quickly data can be translated into actionable information. A winning tool should allow a coach to make a decision in seconds, not minutes.


* **ROI and Automation:** Sam Saxena has a history of building "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG) pipelines that automate manual processes, such as captioning and script drafting, to save hundreds of thousands of dollars. Judges will look for tools that significantly reduce manual preparation time for coaching staff.


* **Human-AI Collaboration:** Projects that support "perceptual complementarity"—where the AI explains its uncertainty or the reasoning behind a recommendation—are highly valued, as they increase human decision confidence by over 8%.



#### **3. Meaningful Fan Engagement**

For the minigame category, Andrew La (Events Manager) seeks fast-paced, interactive ideas that resonate with fans at live major events like the LCS or VCT. These should be polished enough for physical booth activations.

### **Bonus Opportunities**

Beyond the main categories, there are $1,000 "Bonus Wins" for participants who provide:

* The most valuable feedback for **JetBrains software or the Junie agent**.


* The best written blog post or video submission documenting the development process.
