# Submission Assets

This folder is **Devpost-ready** and intended to be produced on (or copied from) the **target demo machine**.

## Contents

### `screenshots/`
Pre-captured screenshots (generated via Playwright) suitable for Devpost.

Current files:
- `screenshots/01_landing.png`
- `screenshots/02_start_demo_evidence.png`
- `screenshots/03_scouting_report.png`
- `screenshots/04_verification.png`

### `demo_video.mp4` (must record on target machine)
Record a **90–120s** backup demo video on the target machine (offline) that follows:

`Start Demo` → Evidence drilldown → `Next` → Pattern evidence → `Integrity/Verification`.

Notes:
- Keep it fully offline (wifi off is fine).
- No runtime LLM calls.
- Use system screen recorder / OBS; save as `submission_assets/demo_video.mp4`.

### `Demo_Script.md`
Short talk-track for the live demo and for the backup video.
