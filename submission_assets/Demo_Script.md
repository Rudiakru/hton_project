### Demo Script (90–120s)

#### 0) Setup line (5s)
“This demo runs **fully offline** from a frozen demo pack. No internet. No runtime LLM calls. Every insight is click-to-verify.”

#### 1) Start Demo (25–35s)
1. Click `Start Demo`.
2. Say:
   - “We start with a **critical moment** from a hero match.”
   - “On the right is the **evidence drawer**: match-scoped context window and the exact event trail that supports the moment.”
3. Click one `Open evidence` link if needed.
   - “Notice we show **match + timestamp** in the header (not raw internal IDs).”

#### 2) Next (25–35s)
1. Click `Next`.
2. Say:
   - “Now we jump to the scouting report: repeatable tendencies (“patterns”).”
   - “Each pattern has example evidence you can drill into.”
3. Click `Open example evidence`.
   - “Again: evidence stays **match-scoped** and is locally shipped in the pack.”

#### 3) Integrity / Verification (20–30s)
1. Scroll to `Verification`.
2. Say:
   - “This panel proves pack integrity: `broken_refs = 0`, match count is `6`, and totals are shown.”
   - “This is the trust layer: if an evidence link could break, it would show up here.”

#### 4) Optional: Validation (10–15s)
Point to `Validation (tiny, manual, directional)`.
“We included a tiny hand-labeled check on two matches: top-3 moments matched X/Y. It’s honest and directional, not a benchmark.”
