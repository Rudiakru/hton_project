demo_video.mp4 is intentionally not committed by the agent.

Record a 90–120s backup demo video ON THE TARGET MACHINE and save it as:

  submission_assets/demo_video.mp4

Required flow:
  Start Demo → evidence drilldown → Next → pattern evidence → Verification/Integrity

Constraints to keep:
  - offline (no internet required)
  - no runtime LLM calls
  - demo runs from extracted `artifacts/demo_pack.tar.gz`
